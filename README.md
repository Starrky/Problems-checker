## After installing Chrome and Python

**For Windows** from project directory in terminal/ powershell run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(To do that go to the folder this project is downloaded to and **Shift + right click** then select **Open command windows here**, then just simply paste the text from above (it will install all necessarry modules for python so everything works).

### **Configs folder is sent personally, since it contains sensitive data**
**Then ask for access to configs folder, you will have to download it and put into Project root folder (config folder should be visible near APP.py)**

**For ubuntu**  you have to:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install qt
```
